-   This is a sorting visualizer application built using React.js
-   The algorithms that can be visualized currently are **bubble sort**, **insertion sort**, **merge sort** and **quick sort**.
-   The application is responsive and has a dark theme by default, but it has a theme switch which can be used to toggle the light theme.
